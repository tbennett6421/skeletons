On Linux, use sysctl vm.max_map_count on the host to view the current value, 
and see Elasticsearch's documentation on virtual memory for guidance on how 
to change this value. Note that the limits must be changed on the host; they 
cannot be changed from within a container.

## Change virtual memory limit
    sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

## Set virtual memory limit permanently
update the vm.max_map_count setting in /etc/sysctl.conf. 
To verify after rebooting, run 
    sysctl vm.max_map_count
